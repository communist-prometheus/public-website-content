# Rich Media in Blog Posts

Prometheus blog supports a wide range of embedded media. This article demonstrates each type and how it renders within the content area.

## Raster Photography

Standard photographs and raster images are automatically optimized by Astro — converted to modern formats (AVIF, WebP) and served in multiple sizes for responsive loading.

Raster images work well for photographs, screenshots, and any content with complex color gradients. Astro processes them at build time, so there is zero runtime overhead.

## Vector Graphics

SVG images are ideal for diagrams, icons, and technical illustrations. They scale to any size without losing quality and have tiny file sizes.

Vector images are particularly useful for:

- **Architecture diagrams** — like the one above
- **Flowcharts** and decision trees
- **Icons** and brand assets
- **Data visualizations** and charts

## Video

Embedded video allows for tutorials, demos, and visual storytelling. The player supports standard controls — play, pause, volume, fullscreen.

<video controls preload="metadata" width="100%">
  <source src="/media/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

Video files are served as static assets from the `public/` directory. For production use, consider a CDN or adaptive streaming for larger files.

## Audio

Audio embeds are useful for podcasts, music samples, or narration. The native browser player provides playback controls.

<audio controls preload="metadata">
  <source src="/media/sample.m4a" type="audio/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

Audio files follow the same serving strategy as video — static assets with native browser playback.

## Media Best Practices

When adding media to articles, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. **Images**: Place in the article's `assets/` folder — Astro optimizes them automatically
2. **Vector graphics**: Use SVG for diagrams and illustrations
3. **Video**: Keep files small or use external hosting for longer content
4. **Audio**: Provide captions or transcripts for accessibility
5. **Alt text**: Always describe visual content for screen readers
